## Contributing

Creating release apk needs a keystore file. You can create your own keystore file using the following command in root folder:
`keytool -genkey -v -keystore headunit-release-key.jks -alias headunit-revived -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`  

After that you need to set the env variables depending on your OS:
MAC:
open ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc

`sudo nano ~/.zshrc or sudo nano ~/.bashrc`   
`export HEADUNIT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"  
export HEADUNIT_KEY_PASSWORD="YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD"`  

## Original Headunit
Headunit for Android Auto (tm)

A new car or a $600+ headunit is NOT required to enjoy the integration and distraction reduced environment of Android Auto.

This headunit app can turn a Android 4.1+ tablet supporting USB Host mode into a basic Android Auto compatible headunit.
